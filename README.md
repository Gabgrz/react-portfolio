# React Portfolio

A React portfolio template for developers/designers. This example has been upgraded to React 19 and features a modern, responsive design.

> **ðŸ“… Portfolio Data Note:** The portfolio content (work experience, education, skills, etc.) in this example is from 2019. This is intentional to demonstrate the template structure - you should replace all data in `src/resumeData.js` with your own current information.

2. **Start development server:**
